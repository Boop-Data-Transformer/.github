## 🎯 Core Transformation Features
*   **🔧 One-Click Script Library:** Apply a wide array of pre-built scripts for common tasks: encode/decode Base64, URL, HTML; format/validate JSON; parse JWT tokens; generate hashes (MD5, SHA); and many more.
*   **📝 Simple Scratchpad Interface:** Paste or type any text snippet into a clean, minimal editor and run scripts directly on the content with immediate, in-place results.
*   **🔄 Chained Operations & Custom Scripts:** Run multiple transformations in sequence (e.g., decode Base64 then prettify JSON) and add your own custom JavaScript scripts to extend functionality.

## About Boop
Boop is a lightweight, dedicated tool for developers, sysadmins, and anyone who frequently works with text-based data that needs quick inspection or transformation. It addresses the common frustration of switching between browser tabs, terminal windows, and online tools to perform simple operations like decoding a JWT, formatting a minified JSON payload, or converting character encodings. By providing a persistent, offline-capable scratchpad coupled with a powerful plugin system, Boop turns these ad-hoc tasks into one-click operations, streamlining debugging, API testing, and data analysis workflows.

The application's power comes from its extensible script system. While it includes a robust default set of scripts covering cryptography, encoding, formatting, and data manipulation, users can easily browse and install additional scripts shared by the community or write their own using JavaScript. This makes Boop adaptable to niche use cases, such as transforming log formats, sanitizing data, or applying custom regex patterns. Its focus on simplicity and speed—opening instantly and keeping your text between sessions—makes it an indispensable utility that lives in your dock or taskbar, ready to "boop" your data into shape at a moment's notice.
